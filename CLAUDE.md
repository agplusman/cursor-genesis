# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

cursor-genesis is a leaf node in the knowledge-graph system, providing Cursor AI collaboration components and knowledge assets. It produces reusable prompt engineering assets (Rules, Capabilities, Patterns, Code Templates) that downstream projects consume via sparse checkout.

### Architecture Position

```
knowledge-graph (upper layer - indexing, association, governance)
    ↓
cursor-genesis (this repo - content production)
    ↓
downstream projects (consumers via sparse checkout)
```

### Responsibilities

- Produce Cursor-related components and knowledge
- Accept improvement backflow from downstream projects
- Expose standardized index (`stable/knowledge/index.yaml`) for upper-layer retrieval

### Out of Scope

- Cross-domain knowledge association (knowledge-graph responsibility)
- Governance framework design (leaf-node-framework responsibility)

## Key Concepts

### Atoms + Packs Two-Layer Architecture

- **Atoms**: Smallest reusable units, context-agnostic
- **Packs**: User-facing scenario combinations (users choose packs, not atoms)

### Four-Layer Cognition (Capabilities)

- `01_insight/`: Insight and analysis (requirements, market analysis)
- `02_architecture/`: Structure and design (architecture, tech evaluation)
- `03_engineering/`: Implementation (coding, engineering)
- `04_quality/`: Quality assurance (auditing, acceptance criteria)

### v1-talk Package

Talk-only mode with 6 team patterns:
- Virtual Streamlit Team - Python/Streamlit development
- Strategic Research Team - Go/No-Go feasibility assessment
- Topic Research Team - Academic/technical deep research
- Domain Driven Design - DDD modeling
- AI Migration Team - Legacy system takeover
- Knowledge System Team - Knowledge management

Dynamic routing via `rules/teams/*.mdc` using Signal → Pattern → Role decision matrix.

## Common Operations

### Sparse Checkout for Downstream Projects

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/you/cursor-genesis.git .cursor-genesis
cd .cursor-genesis
git sparse-checkout set stable/packs/v1-talk stable/atoms/rules stable/atoms/capabilities
```

### Legacy Code Scanner

```bash
cd scripts
pip install -r legacy_scanner_requirements.txt
python legacy_scanner.py --target /path/to/legacy/project
```

Environment variables: `LLM_API_BASE`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`

## Backflow Process

When improvements are made in downstream projects:

1. Fork and create branch: `backflow/my-improvement`
2. Create directory: `backflow/pending/{project-hash}/{contributor}/{commit-id}/`
3. Copy and fill `backflow/TEMPLATE.md` as `SUBMISSION.md`
4. Add content to `content/` subdirectory
5. Submit PR

See `backflow/README.md` and `docs/downstream-spec.md` for details.

## File Conventions

- Rules use `.mdc` extension (Markdown with Cursor metadata)
- Skills use `.skill.yaml` extension
- Knowledge index uses `solves` field for problem-oriented lookup
- Node metadata in `meta.yaml` follows leaf-node-framework spec

## Integration with knowledge-graph

Upper layer links to `stable/knowledge/` (not the entire repo):
```bash
# In knowledge-graph/data/nodes/
cursor-genesis -> ../../../cursor-genesis/stable/knowledge
```

Only `stable/knowledge/` contains cognitive content for upper-layer indexing.
